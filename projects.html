      <h1>Aachen Theater</h1>
      <h2>A reconstruction of the Aachen Theater how it looked 1825.</h2>
      <p>
        My biggest project until now. Together with a friend we got hired by the most renowned history
        museum in Aachen, the "Centre Charlemagne". They wanted us to create a model 3D-Model of the 
        Aachen Theater. But with one twist. They wanted it to look like the theater looked 200 years 
        ago when it was built. There were no fotos out of this time, only drawings. <br>
        We recreated this theater in about 50 hours of work using the CAD software Fusion 360.
        A picture of the finished model can be found on the right.

      <h1>Fictional city</h1>
      <p>
        With the 3D-printing extracurricular activity at my German school we created a more than
        4m<sup>2</sup> big fictional city which serves the rescue service for disaster protection planning.
        It contains different houses, shops, a school, a church and a fun park. All the 3D-models have
        been created in the script-based CAD software "OpenSCAD" where the models get defined through
        coordinates, tables and triangles. It also requires a wide knowledge in mathematics to create
        models into the smallest details. Click <a href="https://www.hgg-broich.de/2025/09/starke-kooperation-fuer-den-katastrophenschutz/">here</a>
        to see our results.

      <h1>Decoupler H0</h1>
      <p>
        This project started with a simple need: I own a model railway and wanted to decouple coaches
        and engines in narrow areas. To do this you need to reach under the coupling and pull a lever.
        I searched a 3D-model but I could not find any good ones. So I decided to create one myself. <br>
        After longer testing and iterating I managed to find the perfect shape. I uploaded it to to 
        different websites and by now it has nearly 300 downloads or prints. You can find the link on
        <a href="contact.html">here</a>.
